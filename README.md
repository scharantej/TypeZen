## Flask Design for an AI-Powered Pretyping Evaluation Experiment

**HTML Files:**

- `index.html`:
   - Main landing page for participants to access.
   - HTML form for participants to enter their basic information (e.g., name, age, typing experience level).
   - Button to start the typing test (before using the pretyping application).
- `typing_test.html`:
   - Page where participants take the typing test.
   - Displays a text passage for participants to type accurately.
   - JavaScript code to measure typing speed and accuracy.
- `results.html`:
   - Page that displays the results of the typing test.
   - Compares the participant's scores before and after using the pretyping application.

**Routes:**

- `/`: Handles the rendering of the `index.html` page.
- `/typing_test`: Handles the rendering of the `typing_test.html` page.
- `/results`: Handles the submission of the typing test results and the rendering of the `results.html` page.
- `/pretyping_app`: Handles the logic associated with the pretyping application.
   - Can be customized to include the specific exercises and activities of the pretyping application.
- `/pretyping_app/results`: Routes participants to the typing test again after they have completed the pretyping application.
